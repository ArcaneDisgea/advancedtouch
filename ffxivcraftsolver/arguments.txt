Required in all modes:
-j class
	crafter class
-r recipe (default: "sequence.json")
	file containing recipe stats to use
-f statsfile (default: "levels.json")
	file to read containing food and crafter statistics

Quality:
-i initial (default 0)
	initial quality
-q (default)
	maximize the HQ% chance using the quality in the recipe file
-m
	no recipe quality. in solve mode, maximize the mean quality produced
-c collectability
	set recipe quality to this x10. in solve mode, maximize the number of synths that reach it

Seed options:
-s sequencefile (default "sequence.json" in single and multi modes)
	in single or multisim mode, the sequence to simulate
	in solve mode, the sequence to start solving from
-e (default in solve mode)
	in single or multisim mode, simulates an empty sequence
	in solve mode, starts solving from an empty sequence

Solver options:
-t strategy (default standard)
	standard: try to guarantee successful craft, then per quality option
	hqorbust: consider an nq result to be equivalent to a failed synth
	nqonly: ignore quality in result
-n
	ignore the "food" section of the options file, i.e. do not use food
